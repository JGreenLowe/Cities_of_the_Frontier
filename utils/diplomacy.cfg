They must have hay and oats and horseshoes and a warm stable for the winter; I cannot haul such things all the way from Weldyn. Or, if you prefer, my slender godson here is very skilled with a slender rapier. He has been looking for a new adventure, and he eats much less than a horse. Why, when he was a boy, we practically had to tie him to the table just to get him to eat! I think you will have no trouble supporting him."
