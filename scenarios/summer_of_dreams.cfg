		{TUTORIAL begin_summer1 _"You have survived the first spring of the campaign. In the summer daylight is longer and the nights are shorter. With the summer sun also comes the likelihood of raiders descending on your town. Such raiding parties are much larger than outlaw bands. Orc raiding parties are most common, and will approach from the North or East. Unlike outlaws, orcs will also establish camps and continue to recruit new units until you hunt down and eliminate their leader. Necromancers and their undead minions may also occasionally trouble you, approaching from the South or West."}
