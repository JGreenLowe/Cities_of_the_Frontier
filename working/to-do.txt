To-do:

For 0.6.2
-Remove / overwrite with blank label if a building burns down




For 0.7
-add in some labels automatically (town center, first farm, first death (gravestone?), others?)
-add "keep loss" event
-make calamities occur on randomized or at least different turns
-something about outlaws group size related to num_villages?
	-currently 6 at normal
	-want 7-8 at ~20 villages
	-min ~4-5, or they won't make it through the animals
- animal AI (random movement, make my own)


- [check] fix red outlaws not burning villages (no capture event fired)
- [check] make your keep have an overlay to distinguish it from others
- [check] prevent leader from picking up relics (he's a coward)
- [check] upgrade keep to stone
- [check] limit outlaws attacking orc leaders (more AI fiddling)
- [check] fix orc gets attacked disrupting goto (attack event?)
- [check] return outlaws to leaders, have them [avoid] orc leaders rather than orc keeps

For 0.8
- accompanying winter calamities?
	-add goblin/wolves in winter calamity (add to gryphons, maybe other)
	-add yeti winter calamity
-somehow avoid loyalist/necro collision (both can come from south)
- more items
- copy boars in from Borstep campaign

- (fix) heal units in recall list 2 per turn
- (fix) villages should heal/cure at start of new scenario
- un-build (demolish existing buildings)
- think about having fog only at night during the summer
- Merchants?
- mercenaries (dwarves, gryphon rider, knight) who stay and help you fight but cost money and disappear permanently if you tell them to stand down
- fix recall list healing macro


Final polishing - 0.8 - 1.0
- workers cannot build after fighting (i.e. must have an attack left)

- more incidental music, set music selections by season
- would like more long, thin mountain ranges with some impassables to create chokepoints?
- pine hills on temperature, not height
- cave option for relics (several spaces wide)
- Tutorial (polish)
- outlaws should not appear too near orc camps
- unit commentary
- story boards - improve

- improve building graphics (up to mediocre)
- worker graphics, animations (fight)
- embellishments?
- all right-click icons
- fix bridge directions
- change hero's name on re-name (if possible)
- balancing, balancing, balancing
- no building/stream on signs, orc check before building their keep


Working notes:

Calamity list:
1. Lich (so bad, there's only one)
2. Gryphons + goblin marauders (wolf rider, pillager, direwolf, etc. in winter)
3. "evil" loyalist army
4. Group of saurians moves in + yetis in winter

Some other calamity ideas:
5. Dread bat infestation (evil!)
6. Goblin tribe (many, many units)
7. "Activation" of magical relic that spawns creatures: mud crawlers, fire guardians

no possible calamity first summer
