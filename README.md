# Cities_of_the_Frontier

This is the codebase for Cities of the Frontier, a campaign in the open-source game of Wesnoth that encourages players to build their own city and then defend it from outlaws and orcs. The code has been optimized for Version 1.16 of Wesnoth.

The code was forked from a copy of the Wild Frontiers campaign being maintained by virtualghetto, which in turn was forked from a much earlier version of the original Cities of the Frontier campaign developed most recently by esci.

I will continue to maintain this version for the next few years to deal with bug reports and complaints about game balance, especially if you can be specific about what is wrong, but I have no plans to update the game for future editions of Wesnoth. If you would like to take over as the maintainer for a future edition, please feel free to do so.
