# Cities_of_the_Frontier

This is the codebase for Cities of the Frontier, a campaign in the open-source game of Wesnoth that encourages players to build their own city
and then defend it from outlaws and orcs. The code is being optimized for Version 1.16 of Wesnoth, which has not yet been released, but which
is being approximated by 1.15.14 (the current development version).

The code was forked from a copy of the Wild Frontiers campaign being maintained by virtualghetto, which in turn was forked from a much earlier version
of the original Cities of the Frontier campaign developed most recently by esci.
